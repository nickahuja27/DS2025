1. Parent of Backtracking is Recursion
2. Number of Choices is large
3. It has Controlled Recursion
4. Pass by Reference

General Pattern

    public void solve(Pass by Reference Object) {
        if(isSolved()) {
            Print or save the result somewhere.
        }
        // 2. Number of choices are large compared to recursion only that had 2 choices.
        // Hence the for loop
        for(i -> n)
            isValidChoice() // 3. Controlled Recursion {
                // 4. Add the choice
                solve(Ref. Object)
                // 4. Remove the Choice
            }
    }

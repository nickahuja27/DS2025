Look for the following keywords in the question
- Is there "K"?
- Smallest or Largest

If K + smallest -> make the Max Heap
If K + Largest -> make the Min Heap

Natural order of PriorityQueue
    - Highest numbers are at the bottom and lowest are at the top
    When you remove, the lowest will be removed first.
